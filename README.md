# Work Day Schedule Web Application
Christine Clemens - Fifth Homework Submission for the SCS Coding Bootcamp

### Objective:
    The aim of this assignment was to successfully code the interactive javascript necessary to complete an interactive work day schedule web application in order to enter and record tasks according to their assigned times. The saved information is intended to be retrieved at a later time using local storage retrieval.

### For this assignment, I was required to:
* Display the current date and local time at the top of the page within the paragraph element.
* Present the user with 8 time blocks representing each hour of the work day.
* Mark time blocks appropriately with the hour, a text input field, and a save button.
* Program each time block to correlate with the current time, changing colours appropriately.
* Allow the user to enter text within the input box.
* Make the button elements clickable and functional.
* Allow the user to save information to local storage by clicking the save button for each text block.
* Display the information stored to local storage.
* Ensure that information stored to local storage persists when the application is closed and reopened.

### I was also encouraged to:
* Tweak the preset CSS styling for best results.

*I really enjoyed this assignment as I was able to really clarify, understand, and apply many concepts that until this point, I had understood but felt unprepared to put into practice. For the best aesthetic result, I opted to tweak some of the CSS properties, but tried to remain as faithful to the original styling as possible.
